# GWAS pipeline for association testing and independent variant detection

A software pipeline for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). A linear or logistic regression can be conducted in order to identify genetic variants associated with a quantitative or a binary trait. The pipeline also includes two methods (`GCTA-COJO` and `PLINK-CLUMP`) for the identification of independent genetic variants, i.e., variants that are in linkage equilibrium.
