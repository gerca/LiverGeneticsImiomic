# Genetic correlations & gene prioritization

This repository contains an HTML report summarizing genetic correlations, gene prioritization, and locus-specific associations for liver-related traits. The report includes statistical results and visualizations to aid interpretation. Open `liver_gencorr_geneprio.html` in a web browser to explore the findings interactively, or [view the report here](https://gerca.github.io/LiverGeneticsImiomic/postGWAS/liver_gencorr_geneprio.html).
