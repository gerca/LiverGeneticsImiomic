Sscript files for the "Genetic studies of liver fat and volume using whole-body MRI and extensive phenotyping provide metabolic insights" manuscript are provided here.
These scripts are related to post-GWAS analysis.
All FID codes for liver measures (liver fat and volume), biomarkers, NAFLD, and CLD are provided as a supplementary file in the manuscript.
SNPs_association_with_biomarkers.do: This file demonstrates the linear regression analysis between liver-associated SNPs (liver fat and liver volume) and biomarkers.
SNPs_association_with_NAFLD_CLD_alcohol_status.do: This file demonstrates the logistic regression analysis between liver-associated SNPs (liver fat and liver volume) and NAFLD, CLD (chronic liver disease), and alcohol status.
age_at_the_imaging.do: This script file explains how the age at the time of imaging was calculated.
