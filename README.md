# "Genetic Studies of Liver Fat and Volume Using Whole-Body MRI and Extensive Phenotyping Provide Metabolic Insights"
This repository includes analyses of SNP selection, genetic correlations, gene prioritization, imaging-based associations, and trait associations. We identified independent SNPs using COJO and LD clumping, assessed genetic correlations with LDSC, and prioritized genes using cS2G and Open Targets Genetics. Fine mapping was performed with CARMA. Whole-body MRI data was analyzed using Imiomics to map liver-trait SNP associations with regional fat distribution. Finally, multivariable regression in UK Biobank (N=310,239) examined associations between liver-associated variants, alcohol intake, metabolic traits, and chronic liver disease using ICD-coded records. See the Supplementary Text for details.
